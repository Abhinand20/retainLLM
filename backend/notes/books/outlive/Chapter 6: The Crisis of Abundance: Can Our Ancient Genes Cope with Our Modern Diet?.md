## Chapter 6: The Crisis of Abundance: Can Our Ancient Genes Cope with Our Modern Diet?

This chapter explores the growing issue of metabolic dysfunction, particularly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more serious form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as indicators of a larger metabolic health crisis. The chapter highlights the mismatch between our evolutionary past and our modern environment. 

**Key Ideas:**

* **The Silent Epidemic:** NAFLD and NASH are becoming increasingly prevalent, often undiagnosed, and signify a broader issue of metabolic dysfunction.
* **Metabolic Dysfunction vs. Obesity:** Obesity is just one symptom of metabolic dysfunction, which is characterized by insulin resistance, fat accumulation in organs, and a cluster of health risks.
* **The Fructose Factor:** Our evolutionary history equipped us to store fat from fructose for survival. In our modern environment saturated with fructose, this adaptation has become detrimental.
* **Early Detection and Intervention:** Identifying early warning signs of metabolic dysfunction, such as elevated insulin and certain biomarkers, is crucial for timely intervention.

**Deeper Explanations:**

* **Fat Storage and Spillover:**  The body stores excess calories as fat, primarily in subcutaneous fat. However, when this capacity is exceeded, fat spills over to organs like the liver and muscles, leading to problems like NAFLD and insulin resistance.
* **Insulin Resistance:** This occurs when cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to elevated blood glucose and eventually type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance also promotes fat storage and increases the risk of other diseases.
* **The Role of Uric Acid:** Fructose metabolism produces uric acid. While other mammals possess an enzyme to clear it, humans do not. This leads to fat storage and is linked to health issues like gout and high blood pressure.
* **Fructose Overload:** Unlike naturally occurring fructose in fruits, large quantities of liquid fructose, commonly found in processed foods and drinks, overwhelm our system, leading to fat accumulation in the liver.

**Implementable Takeaways:**

* **Regularly check your liver enzymes**: Even if you're not obese, ask your doctor for a liver function test, specifically ALT, to detect early signs of NAFLD.
* **Get a DEXA scan**: This scan provides a more accurate picture of your body composition, including visceral fat, which is a more significant risk factor than overall body fat.
* **Request an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):**  This test can reveal early signs of insulin resistance, even before fasting glucose levels become elevated.
* **Limit Fructose Intake**: Be mindful of added sugars, especially in processed foods and drinks. Focus on consuming fructose from whole fruits, which provide fiber and nutrients that mitigate negative effects.
* **Prioritize Physical Activity:** Exercise helps improve insulin sensitivity and promotes the utilization of stored fat, counteracting the effects of a sedentary lifestyle.

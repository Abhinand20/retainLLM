##  The Representativeness Heuristic

This chapter dives into the **representativeness heuristic**, a mental shortcut we use to judge the probability of something based on how well it matches our existing stereotypes or mental models.  It often leads to biased judgments, especially when we ignore important base-rate information. 

**Key Ideas:**

* **Base Rates:** The actual frequency of something in a population (e.g., the proportion of humanities students in a university).
* **Representativeness:** How similar an event or person is to our existing stereotype (e.g., does Tom W's personality fit the "computer scientist" stereotype?).
* **The Tom W Problem:**  A classic experiment demonstrating how people favor representativeness over base rates when making predictions.
* **Sins of Representativeness:**
    * **Overpredicting Unlikely Events:**  We tend to overestimate the probability of events that are rare but highly representative (e.g., a shy poetry lover studying Chinese literature).
    * **Ignoring Evidence Quality:** We readily accept information as true, even when it's unreliable, because of the "What You See Is All There Is" (WYSIATI) principle.
* **Disciplining Intuition:**
    * **Bayesian Reasoning:**  A mathematical framework for updating our beliefs in light of new evidence. It emphasizes the importance of base rates and the diagnosticity of evidence.
    * **Anchor on Base Rates:** Begin with the base rate frequency of an event as a starting point for your predictions.
    * **Question Evidence Diagnosticity:**  Critically evaluate how strongly the evidence supports your hypothesis.

**Take Away:**

* **Don't Overestimate Stereotypes:** When making predictions, consider base rates and not just how well something matches a stereotype.
* **Beware of Unreliable Evidence:**  Be wary of accepting information at face value, especially if it's emotionally charged or comes from a questionable source.
* **Think Like a Statistician:** Practice Bayesian reasoning to improve your decision-making by considering base rates and the quality of evidence.

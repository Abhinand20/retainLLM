Prospect Theory: The Psychology of Decision Making


Â 

Prospect theory is a psychological theory of decision making that was developed by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in the 1970s and 1980s. It is an alternative to the traditional economic theory of decision making, which is based on the assumption that people make rational decisions based on a careful calculation of the expected utility of each available option. Prospect theory, on the other hand, suggests that people make decisions based on their emotional responses to gains and losses, and that these responses are influenced by a number of psychological factors, including the reference point from which the options are evaluated, the perceived probability of each outcome, and the perceived value of each outcome.
One of the key insights of prospect theory is that people are loss averse, meaning that they tend to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains of equivalent value. This means that people are more likely to take risks to avoid a loss than they are to take risks to acquire a gain. For example, if you are offered a gamble that gives you a 50% chance of winning $100 and a 50% chance of losing $100, most people would be reluctant to take the gamble, even though the expected value of the gamble is zero. This is because the potential loss of $100 looms larger in people's minds than the potential gain of $100.
Another important concept in prospect theory is the reference point. The reference point is the starting point from which people evaluate the value of each option. For example, if you are currently earning $50,000 per year and are offered a job that pays $60,000 per year, you might be happy with the offer, because it represents a gain of $10,000. However, if you were previously earning $70,000 per year and are offered the same job, you might be disappointed, because the job represents a loss of $10,000 relative to your previous salary. The reference point can have a powerful influence on people's decisions, because it affects the way they perceive the value of each option.
Prospect theory also suggests that people are more sensitive to changes in the status quo than they are to changes in absolute values. For example, if you are offered a choice between receiving $100 now or receiving $110 in a year, most people would prefer to receive the $110 in a year, even though the difference between the two options is only $10. This is because the potential gain of $10 in a year is perceived as less valuable than the potential loss of $10 now.
Prospect theory has been widely studied and has been found to be a useful tool for understanding a wide range of decision-making phenomena. It has been used to explain a variety of anomalies in economic behavior, such as the endowment effect, the status quo bias, and the sunk cost fallacy. It has also been used to develop new strategies for marketing and negotiation, such as framing effects and anchoring.
Overall, prospect theory provides a valuable alternative to the traditional economic theory of decision making, and it offers a more realistic and nuanced understanding of how people make decisions in the real world. By taking into account the emotional and psychological factors that influence decision making, prospect theory provides a more complete and accurate model of human behavior.

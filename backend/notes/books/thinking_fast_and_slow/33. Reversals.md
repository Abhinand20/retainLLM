## Speaking of Keeping Score

* **Regret and Hindsight Bias:** People often anticipate more regret than they actually experience due to underestimating their psychological defenses. To mitigate regret, consciously consider the possibility of regret before making decisions. Thoroughness or casualness in decision-making can prevent hindsight bias.
* **Mental Accounting:** We tend to create separate mental accounts for different types of money (cash vs. credit) or investments (stocks), leading to irrational financial decisions. Remember that all money is equal, and avoid the "disposition effect" of holding onto losing investments to avoid closing the mental account at a loss.
* **Taboo Tradeoffs:**  We often make irrational choices when presented with a "taboo tradeoff," where opting for a less expensive option feels like a loss, even if it's objectively a better choice. For example, choosing a cheaper car seat despite feeling like it's less safe.

## Reversals

* **Preference Reversals:** People's preferences can change when presented with options in single vs. joint evaluations. This is because joint evaluation focuses attention on aspects that were less salient in single evaluation, leading to different outcomes. For example, the severity of a victim's injury is more important in joint evaluation than the location where the incident happened.
* **Challenging Economics:** Preference reversals challenge the rational-agent model in economics, which assumes consistent preferences. This finding has led to a greater willingness among economists to consider psychological research in their models.

## Categories

* **Incoherent Choices:** Judgments and preferences are coherent within categories but potentially incoherent across categories. This can lead to irrational decisions when comparing items with different norms. For example, judging a six-year-old boy's height against a different norm than a 16-year-old boy.
* **Evaluating Causes:**  We often make contributions based on emotional responses to a cause, rather than a rational assessment of its urgency. For example, donating more to save dolphins than to support farmworkers' healthcare, even though the latter might be objectively more pressing.
* **Evaluability Hypothesis:**  Attributes that are not easily quantifiable ("evaluable") are often overlooked in single evaluation, but become salient in joint evaluation. For example, the number of entries in a music dictionary is more important in joint evaluation than its condition.

## Unjust Reversals

* **Legal System Incoherence:** The legal system often relies on single evaluation, which can lead to inconsistent judgments. For example, mock jurors awarded more punitive damages to a bank that lost money than to a child who suffered burns, but reversed their judgment when the cases were compared side-by-side.
* **Administrative Punishments:** Penalties for violations across different government agencies are often inconsistent, revealing inconsistencies in the application of fairness and judgment.

## **Takeaways**

* **Be Aware of Emotional Biases:**  Recognize that our emotional reactions can influence our decisions, especially in single evaluations.
* **Seek Broader Contexts:** When making important decisions, consider a broader context by looking at multiple perspectives and comparing options. 
* **Question Taboo Tradeoffs:**  Don't be afraid to question assumptions and consider all options, even if they seem like "taboo tradeoffs." 
* **Challenge the Status Quo:** Be willing to challenge accepted norms and established practices, especially when it comes to fairness and justice.

## Speaking of Frames and Reality 

* **Framing Effects:** The way a choice is presented can significantly influence our decisions, even if the underlying options are objectively the same. 
* **Loss Aversion:** We tend to feel the pain of a loss more strongly than the pleasure of an equivalent gain. This can lead to irrational decisions, such as holding onto investments that are losing value.
* **Reframing:** Changing the reference point for a decision can help us make more rational choices. For example, instead of focusing on the money lost, consider how much money was kept. 

## Two Selves

* **Experienced Utility vs. Decision Utility:** There's a distinction between what we actually experience (experienced utility) and what we anticipate wanting (decision utility). These two may not always align.
* **Hedonimeter:** A theoretical instrument that measures the intensity of pleasure or pain experienced over time. This concept helps us understand how to measure experienced utility. 
* **Peak-End Rule:** Our memory of an experience is heavily influenced by the peak intensity of pleasure or pain and how it felt at the end, regardless of the overall duration. 
* **Duration Neglect:**  We tend to underweight the duration of an experience when forming our overall memory, focusing primarily on the peak and end. 
* **Remembering Self vs. Experiencing Self:** The remembering self is responsible for our memories and influences our decisions. The experiencing self is the one who actually lives through the experience.  These two selves may have different priorities, leading to irrational choices.
* **Cold-Hand Experiment:** This experiment demonstrates the conflict between the experiencing and remembering selves. Participants who experienced a slightly warmer water temperature in the final 30 seconds of a 90-second cold water immersion preferred to repeat the longer, ultimately more painful, experience due to a more favorable memory of the ending.
* **Less-is-More Effect:**  Our tendency to represent sets by averages and prototypes, rather than sums, can lead to counterintuitive preferences. For example, adding broken dishes to a set of dishes can lower the overall perceived value. 
* **Evolutionary Roots:** The remembering self's tendency to prioritize peak and end experiences has deep evolutionary roots, evident in the similar behavior of rats who focus on the intensity of pain or pleasure rather than its duration. 

**Takeaways:**

* **Be aware of framing effects.**  When making decisions, consider how the information is presented and try to reframe it to see the situation from multiple perspectives.
* **Recognize the limitations of memory.** Our memories are not always accurate reflections of our experiences. Consider the peak-end rule and duration neglect when evaluating past experiences.
* **Challenge your own preferences.**  Question whether your current preferences reflect your actual interests or are influenced by the remembering self's biases.
* **Don't let the remembering self dictate your actions.**  While the remembering self is powerful, it's important to recognize its biases and make decisions based on your actual needs and desires.
